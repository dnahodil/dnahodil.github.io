If you're a Grails (<a href="http://grails.org" target="_blank">http://grails.org</a>) developer then once you've found a Groovy extension module you'll want to include it into your Grails application. If the library is available through Maven or Grapes (<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grapes+and+grab()" target="_blank">http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grapes+and+grab()</a>) then it's easy to include. If you only have the jar then you'll probably have more difficulty.

I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19564902/applying-groovy-extensions-in-grails-produces-missingmethodexception-for-string" title="Applying Groovy extensions in Grails produces MissingMethodException for String#toBoolean()" target="_blank">this question</a> on StackOverflow to have good information on the changes you'll have to make to have the library included in your application.

There is also a <a href="http://jira.grails.org/browse/GRAILS-10652" title="Make a standard way to load Groovy extensions" target="_blank">Jira ticket</a> for Grails to address the fact that you need to add this code to load such libraries.
