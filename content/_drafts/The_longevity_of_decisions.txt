There are many cases in software engineering where decisions are made that have far-reaching consequences. Sometimes the choices are between some good, logical alternatives and sometimes they might be a bit arbitrary. And of course, once a decision has been made, there are points in the future where others might choose to keep following that decision, or to choose another path. I just want to write about an interesting outcome from an old decision that has been maintained through many systems. This original decision (and its perpetuation) has had an effect on me that was so far beyond anything that might have been predicted that I thought it warranted writing about.
<h3>How I found out about the original decision</h3>
I was trying to create a file on my Windows 7 computer; which should be easy enough. But I was getting an error saying "The specified device name is invalid". A quick Google found the problem; 'aux' is an invalid filename in Windows (regardless of the extension). There is a good explanation of the cause (the original decision) on <a href="http://bitquabit.com/post/zombie-operating-systems-and-aspnet-mvc/" target="_blank">bitquabit</a>.
<h3>What I was actually trying to do</h3>
Where I work we use <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/" target="_blank">Chef</a>&nbsp;to manage provisioning our server infrastructure. This includes virtual servers running on OpenStack and CloudStack. We have configuration files that match each hosts name which tell Chef what software, services, users, etc. need to be installed on each machine. The configurations are in JSON format and we name them for the host they describe. For example there may be a database server and the configuration file would be called <code>db.mycompany.com.json</code>. I was trying to provision a server for auxiliary systems that support our main product, so I had chosen <code>aux.mycompany.com</code> as the hostname. But because of the problem described before, Windows would not let me create this file.
<h3>The consequence</h3>
There was no major hardship; I just needed to choose a different name for my new server. But then it hit me about what I was doing. <strong>I had to rename a virtual server running in the cloud because 40 years ago an operating system had chosen 'aux' as a device name</strong>. Imagine trying to explain that to the guys in 1973!
